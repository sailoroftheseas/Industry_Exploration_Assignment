<h1 id="intro_section">Introduction</h1>

<section id="text_section">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col">I think the company that most excites/interests me is apple. Since I was about 14 I started to gain interest into their technology.  I fell in love with their design and teachnology, so I started teaching myself coding through books and online guides, youtube tutorials, and websites like stack exchange. For the next few years I started making iOS apps for the iphone/ipad.  I love the simplicity and sleekness of their design.  From apple's computers to their website, everything is of high quality and works seamlessly. Apple's clean, intuitive, uncluttered, and seamless design is captivating.  Additionally, Apple’s design practices are incredibly unique and innovative.

<h1 id="working_for_apple_section">What it would be like to work for Apple</h1>

<section id="text_section">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col">If I could get a job at apple that would be a dream come true. I imagine the environment would be a relaxed workspace, where everyone is friendly and communicates ideas and concepts well together, even if theyre from different departments.  Collaborating with other intelligent and innovative developers would be great.  If you work together in a cooperation and friendly way you can accomplish great things.  This would be an ideal situation for me.  It's all about effective and mindful communication.  It also involves constructive criticism and honesty between co workers/collaborators.  I like the thought of that environment.  To get a job at apple I think you would have to show them your intense dedication, enthusiasm, honesty, meticulous work, creativity, and an eye for design. I think working at apple would take a lot of work, long hours, precision and detail, thinking out of the box, and thoroughness in your work/projects. I would want to either create games, website development, graphic design that applies to websites, computer os, mobile apps, or front end software dev (and maybe a little backend development too).  
		I think working there would be a fun, creative experience solving complex problems and developing simple yet powerful applications.  Also, website development would be interesting as well as creating the graphics to go with the software/apps/games.

<section id="text_section">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col">
	I would like to think that im good at playing the piano, fishing, dirt biking, rock climbing, problem solving, fixing engines, creating graphics, making music, writing, design, interface design, resourceful thinking, and hard-working.

<h1 id="daily_technology_section">Daily Technology Use</h1>

<section id="text_section">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col">I use my iPhone, iwatch, samsaung tv, amazon alexa, CarPlay in my car, and mac computer on a daily basis.
</div>
<br><br><br>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col">

	I mianly use my iphone to communicate with people and have access to answers of any of my questions at any time. I use it as a gps, an alarm clock, I use it as a clock, I use it to check my bank account balance and depositing checks, paying people for things, fishing, and learning new skills/knowledge.  I also use it instead of a camera, I have a camera but I mainly use phone because it is so high quality and easy to use.  I use it for listening to music and I use my phone to check the weather.  I can even ask siri to do any task or asnwer any question.  I choose to use the iPhone because of its intuitive, clean, simple, sleek, elegant, and beautifully designed interface. To me the iphone feels natural to use.  The software is amazing and it is easy to use without much of a learning curve.  The iPhone is instinctive to use.

<h1 id="future_education_section">Future Education</h1>

<section id="text_section">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col">I want to learn a lot of things, as much as I can in my lifetime.  I would love to learn how to build and program a computer by scratch. I would like to learn more about the history of the world and its various cultures.  I want to learn as many programming languages as possible. Also I would like to learn other languages. I definitely want to learn how to draw and paint as well as master graphic design.  I want to learn how to build cars, furniture, and knives from scratch.  I would also like to be able to build my own house with my own hands.</div>

</div>

<h1 id="intellectual_challenges_section">Intellectual challenges</h1>

<section id="text_section">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col">What is intellectually challenging about this space is definitively learning all the concepts, copious programming languages, and math involved, and conceptualizing an idea that could be really innovative.  I like the problem solving aspect of working at apple, helping people solve daily issues in a simple manner by using apples software/ui/phone/watch.</div>

</div>

	<h1 id="my_intrests_section">My Interests</h1>

	<section id="text_section">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col">I would like to make the world a better place by creating something innovative and useful that solves a problem.  Or simply just make games that will entertain and bring happiness to people.  I want to help the world progress in the right direction through innovation. </div>
		
		 <div class="col">I love the problem solving aspect of coding, like debugging and writing algorithms to execute a certain procedure.  I like making something from scratch and imagining the concept in my head and then actually creating it in reality.  I think its fascinating that you can tell a computer pretty much anything to do by writing code. Its so interesting that you can make programs that have the potential to make computers/mobile devices accomplish incredible tasks, solve problems, and preform amazing things. </div>
		
		 <div class="col">However, I dont have much interest in back end developing.  However want to learn about although find it incredibly boring. I don’t want to just be writing code every day, I want to take place in interface design, graphic design, front end development.  Althogh interesting, I find networking boring as well. I want to know how it everything works but I wouldn’t want to be in those fields. I want to do something that i enjoy, something that makes it feel like your not even going to work your just doing something that you are passionate about.
